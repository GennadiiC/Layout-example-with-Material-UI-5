# Layout-example-with-Material-UI-5
A cat rescue volunteer organisation page layout using React JS and Material UI-5.  "Mobile first" approach was used.
It's just a static layout without any outer paths attached.

Also I added some tests for main container components, 4 suites in total with multiply tests inside of each, using React Testing Library.
